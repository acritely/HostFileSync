# HostsFileSync
A python script to copy the host file from someonewhocares.org and update your machine's local hosts file. Using the hosts file to point specific url's to 0.0.0.0 or an arbitrary ip not only saves bandwidth by avoiding transferring any data from the the url, but also serves as a passive layer of security. @DanPollock maintains a current list of suspicious and advertising data collection url's on his fantastic website listed above. Use this script to keep your local hosts file up to date.

To use, copy the file matching your python version to your local machine and execute from the command prompt. Edit the url in the file to sync with a different hosts file.
